                <p>Veggie grill produce is ethically sourced from around the world. What you eat matters. And not just to you. The things you choose to put in your body donâ€™t only have an enormous effect on your health, but on the environment, and our collective future. Our founders T.K., Kevin and Ray discovered that back in 2006. They found that they not only felt better physically on a plant-based diet, but felt inspired by their ability to help heal the planet simply through the food they consumed. With a desire to share this sense of empowerment with others, they launched Veggie Grill, now the largest, most influential vegan and vegetarian restaurant company in the U.S.</p>

        <p>By eating plant-based meals, we can significantly lower the greenhouse gas emissions produced by factory farming that contribute heavily to global warming. We also minimize agricultural land use and save water, both of which are critically important to the health of the Earth and all of us who live on it.

            A plant-based diet can also reduce heart-disease, cancer, and other illnesses that are tied to saturated animal fats and cholesterol, ruining lives and bank accounts due to increased healthcare costs.
            
            Of course, a  plant-based diet is also more humane in regard to the treatment of animals.</p>
